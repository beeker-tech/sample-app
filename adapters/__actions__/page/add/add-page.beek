The language is typescript and the framework is react.js.

Create a component named Page in PascalCase with:

The following imports:
- import { Title, Text } from '@tremor/react';

And the following template:
(
  <main className="p-4 md:p-10 mx-auto max-w-7xl">
    <Title>{{title}}</Title>
    <Text>{{subtitle}}</Text>
  </main>
)

Do not import react if not needed.
Make sure Page is exported as default;

Make it pretty with prettier.
